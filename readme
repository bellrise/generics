Clean Generics
==============

A generics library for C++ to write clean code with. I decided to write some
C++ code coming from a C background, but everything seems overcomplicated for
what is needs to do. I still wanted to write C, but what I've been missing is
metaprogramming and object-orientation, which I could find in C++.
